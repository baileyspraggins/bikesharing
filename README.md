# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
An analysis on NYC Citi Bike Data and its application to expanding to Des Moines, Iowa.
## Summary
In this analysis we can conclude that Des Moines Iowa would be a good spot to put a bikesharing service in, because of its extisting presence of popular bike tours, as well information gathered by the bike league in the organizations yearly report. We also believe that the Amount of McDonalds and the locations of those McDonalds have little to no effect bike data. 

### Story Points
In the first story point there is a summary of the number of important data that coresponds with Citi Bike in NYC. This sets the basis of our analysis.

The next point is extremely important to our analysis and it is statistics gathered by the Bike League, which creates rankings for each state in how optimal the state is to bicycle riding. While Iowa is ranked lower than New York it is important to point out that Iowa has a statewide bike plan in order to promote riding as well as 0.5% of people bike to work which is above average relative to other states in the United States. This data was found at https://bikeleague.org/content/state-report-cards 

The next story point is a map of the bike tour routes that the tourist department in Des Moines, IA offers. This shows that the city is extremely biker friendly and has multiple paths that are optimal for riding. This data was found at https://www.catchdesmoines.com/things-to-do/walk-and-bike-tours/

The next story point compares the location of the McDonalds in each city as well as well as the total populations from 2019 which were found at https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,desmoinescityiowa/PST045219

These locations do not show to be of any relevance though, because the there seems to be no correlation between the locations of McDonalds and the starting and ending locations of bike sharring data.

The last three story points all show visualizations that refer to Citi Bike in New York. They are the starting and ending locations of bike trips as well as the timing of trip data.
